# Bagging Ensemble Strategy for Authenticity Prediction

### Ensemble Model Creation

1.  **Individual Model Training**:
    * **Model Initialization**: Each model intended for the ensemble (e.g., BarlowTwins, EfficientNetB3, DenseNet161, ResNet152, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3) is initialized as an authenticity predictor.
    * **Device Placement**: All initialized models are moved to the appropriate computing device (GPU if available, otherwise CPU).

2.  **Bagging and Bootstrapping for Training**:
    * **Bootstrap Dataset Creation**: For each model, a bootstrap sample is created from the original dataset. This involves sampling with replacement to generate a new dataset of the same size as the original, ensuring diversity among the training sets for individual models.
    * **Dataset Assignment**: Models are assigned specific datasets based on their architecture requirements (e.g., DenseNet and InceptionV3 use a DenseNet-specific dataset, while others use ImageNet).
    * **DataLoader Preparation**: A DataLoader is prepared for each model using its corresponding bootstrap sample, facilitating batch processing during training.
    * **Individual Training**: Each model is trained independently on its respective bootstrapped dataset for a specified number of epochs using a defined loss function (e.g., MSELoss) and optimizer (e.g., Adam). The trained model weights are saved.

### Ensemble Prediction

1.  **Model Loading**: Each individual trained model is loaded with its saved weights.
2.  **Ensemble Initialization**: An `EnsembleAuthenticityPredictor` is created, encapsulating all the loaded models and their respective datasets.
3.  **Prediction Aggregation**: For making predictions, the ensemble aggregates outputs from all its constituent models. The final prediction is the average of the individual model predictions.

### Ensemble Evaluation

1.  **Individual Model Testing**: Each model within the ensemble is tested individually on its corresponding test dataset to evaluate its performance (e.g., MSE Loss and RMSE).
2.  **Ensemble Testing**: The entire ensemble is tested to determine its combined performance, providing a comparison against individual model results.
3.  **Performance Comparison**: The loss and RMSE of the ensemble are compared against the best-performing individual model to quantify the improvement achieved by the ensemble approach.
